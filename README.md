# Billionaire Burnout ðŸ’¸

## Project Description
Billionaire Burnout is an interactive web-based simulation where users step into the shoes of an ultra-wealthy individual and strategically manage (or perhaps, mismanage) a vast fortune. The goal is to explore the concept of extreme wealth by making spending decisions on various items, from everyday luxuries to extravagant assets, and observing the financial impact.

## Key Features
* **Interactive Spending Simulation:** Engage with a dynamic interface to make purchasing decisions and track your remaining fortune.
* **Diverse Item Catalog:** A wide array of items available for purchase, reflecting different scales of wealth.
* **AI-Driven Development:** This project was primarily developed through advanced prompt engineering, leveraging AI tools like Genspark AI for design, content generation, and foundational code elements.
